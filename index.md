## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at KNAW Meertens Instituut in Amsterdam and Utrecht University. My research focuses on online discussions, online content moderation and the impact that different actors have on online discussions.

I am currently writing my dissertation on hybrid content moderation of discussions hosted by online news outlets (comment sections). I create computational tools to support the content moderator in their tasks. Specifically, I look at identifying 'good' or 'constructive' comments, which news outlets manually highlight to promote better discussions. Furthermore, I study how content moderators are currently working alongside AI-based tools as well as the opportunities for future collaboration. My PhD project is part of the larger Better-MODS project.

Alongside the work for my dissertation, I look at how you can (computationally) identify large-scale trends in online discussions and measure impact on an online discussion.  

## Current Projects

#### [Better-MODS: Better Informing Citizens About Current Debates](https://better-mods.uvt.nl/)

The BETTER-MODS project is a collaboration between Tilburg University, the KNAW Meertens Institute and NU.nl. This project aims to make online discussions more accessible and create computational tools which contribute to the practice of online content moderation.

#### [Wie is de trol?](https://www.wie-is-de-trol.nl/)

'Wie is de trol?' is  game for school student and libraries to learn about online discussions, content moderation and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is an initiative by researchers from KNAW Meertens Instituut, Tilburg University, together with NEMO Kennislink. Visit the [website](https://www.wie-is-de-trol.nl/) for a full project description.

The game is being developed by Basten Stokhuyzen, Mathilde Jansen and Cedric Waterschoot.
This project is financed by a Dutch Research Agenda 'Science Communication' grant (NWO).
