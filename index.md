## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at KNAW Meertens Instituut in Amsterdam and Utrecht University. My research focusses on online discussions, moderation of such content and the impact that different actors have on online discussions.

I am currently writing my dissertation on hybrid content moderation of discussions hosted by online news outlets (comment sections). I create computational tools to support the content moderator in their tasks. Specifically, I look at identifying 'good' or 'constructive' comments, part of outlets' strategy to promote better discussions. Furthermore, I study how content moderators are currently working alongside AI-based tools as well as the opportunities for future collaboration. My PhD project is part of the larger Better-MODS project.

## Current Projects

#### [Better-MODS: Better Informing Citizens About Current Debates](https://better-mods.uvt.nl/)

The BETTER-MODS project is a collaboration between Tilburg University, the KNAW Meertens Institute and NU.nl. This project aims to make online discussions more accessible and create computational tools which contribute to the practice of online content moderation.

#### [Wie is de trol?](https://www.wie-is-de-trol.nl/)

A game for school student and libraries to learn about online discussions, content moderation and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Together with Basten Stokhuyzen and Mathilde Jansen.
This project is financed by NWO grant 'Science Communication'.
