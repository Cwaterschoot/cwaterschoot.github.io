## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Advances Computing Sciences (DACS) at Maastricht University. Previously, I was a PhD candidate at KNAW Meertens Instituut in Amsterdam and Utrecht University. My research is focused on the computational modelling of subjective decision-making. My interests include Natural Language Processing (NLP), group decision-making (group recommender systems) and automatic summarization. I am currently working on simulations of group consensus, explainable group recommender systems (XAI) and automatic summarization of (imbalanced and chaotic) online discussions.

I wrote my dissertation on hybrid content moderation of discussions hosted by online news outlets (comment sections). You can read my thesis [here](https://research-portal.uu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/242744450/waterschoot2024%20-%20670d023743d3d.pdf). I created computational tools to support the content moderator in their tasks. Specifically, I looked at identifying 'good' or 'constructive' comments, which news outlets manually highlight to promote better discussions. You can read about my research [here](https://www.nemokennislink.nl/publicaties/ai-tilt-discussie-naar-hoger-niveau/) (Dutch). Furthermore, I studied how content moderators are currently working alongside AI-based tools as well as the opportunities for future collaboration. My PhD project was part of the larger Better-MODS project. In the past I have looked at how you can (computationally) identify large-scale trends in online discussions and measure impact/agency of user interaction on news platforms. 

## Current Projects

#### [Wie is de trol?](https://www.wie-is-de-trol.nl/)

'Wie is de trol?' is a game for school students and libraries to learn about online discussions, content moderation and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is an initiative by researchers from KNAW Meertens Instituut, Tilburg University, together with NEMO Kennislink. Visit the [website](https://www.wie-is-de-trol.nl/) for a full project description.

The game is being developed by Basten Stokhuyzen, Mathilde Jansen and Cedric Waterschoot.
This project is financed by a Dutch Research Agenda 'Science Communication' grant (NWO).

## Previous Projects

#### [Better-MODS: Better Informing Citizens About Current Debates](https://better-mods.uvt.nl/)

The BETTER-MODS project is a collaboration between Tilburg University, the KNAW Meertens Institute and NU.nl. This project aims to make online discussions more accessible and to understand how human moderators work alongside AI in the context of hybrid content moderation. Furthermore, we study if people engage in discussions on news articles and the motivation behind their participation.
